# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Bring back check_record(value, limit) and print_report(...) from Week 3
#    (copy them, or rewrite them - either is fine). check_record returns
#    difference, percent and status. print_report does all of the printing,
#    nothing outside it should contain a print() of its own. Give each a
#    one-line docstring.

# your function(s) go here
def check_record(value, limit):
    """Calculates difference, percentage and status."""
    difference = limit - value
    percent = (value / limit) * 100

    if percent >= 100:
        status = "OVER LIMIT"
    elif percent >= 90:
        status = "WARNING"
    else:
        status = "OK"

    return difference, percent, status


def print_report(label, value, limit, difference, percent, status):
    """Prints the report for one record."""
    print("=" * 38)
    print(f"RECORD CHECK - {label}")
    print("=" * 38)
    print(f"Failed logins : {value:10.2f}")
    print(f"Total attempts: {limit:10.2f}")
    print(f"Difference    : {difference:10.2f}")
    print(f"Percentage    : {percent:10.2f}%")
    print(f"Status        : {status:>15}")
    print("=" * 38)
    print()


# ====================================================================== STORE
# 2. Get your records into a list of dicts, each shaped like:
#        {"label": ..., "value": ..., "limit": ...}
#
#    Threshold : write the list directly in the code - at least 3 records.
#    Typical   : instead, write a function load_records(path) that reads
#                label,value,limit lines from a file and returns the list.
#                Make your own data file, one record per line.
#    Excellent : also write the results out to a new file (one line per
#                record: label, status), as well as printing them.
def load_records(path):
    """Loads records from a text file."""
    records = []

    with open(path) as f:
        for line in f:
            label, value, limit = line.strip().split(",")
            records.append({
                "label": label,
                "value": float(value),
                "limit": float(limit)
            })

    return records


records = load_records("Week 04 - Lists, Dictionaries and Files/LAB/cyber_records.txt")

# =============================================================== PROCESS + OUTPUT
# 3. Loop over records. For each one, call check_record and print_report.
#
#    Excellent : also keep a running count of how many were OVER LIMIT, and
#                print that once, after the loop ends.

# your loop goes here
for record in records:
    difference, percent, status = check_record(
        record["value"], record["limit"]
    )

    print_report(
        record["label"],
        record["value"],
        record["limit"],
        difference,
        percent,
        status
    )


# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it and check every record's numbers are correct by hand
#    [ ] If you are loading from a file, check what happens when the file
#        does not exist - write the error down
#    [ ] Check every function still does one job
